# Koding-Kitchen
An app to allow users to quickly find  tasty recipes based on their current cravings, food type, diet, or  ingredients.

## Description

This is a group interactive app where users can search for recipes. This app uses two server-side APIs for giphyâ€™s and recipe retreival. They are https://api.giphy.com and https://api.spoonacular.com. Users will enter a food type to query on, or they can enter ingredients. The software will retrieve recipes that match their input. The app uses client-side storage to store persistent data and uses modals for input. This project was the first introduction to implementing agile development methodologies and Git branch workflow with pull requests. Various merge conflicts were resolved through collaboration. This project was presented to our cohort and instructional staff and deployed on git hub pages.
